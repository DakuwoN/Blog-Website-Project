## My process

I began by creating my repository through Git and then cloning to a remote repository on GitHub. I first organized all of my folders withe the correct files that belong inside them (e.g. images, blog post page, and css). First, I would build my HTML by drawing out my visualization that I had inside my head. This project was tougher than I thought, so I followed the rubric from top to bottom using semantic HTML. Once I completed the HTML, I would then style the page, with beautiful colors. I wanted my page to be colorful and very unique. I made sure I linked all my pages beforehand to their respective pages, along with the CSS files. I did HTML first for both of the pages, and then I did the CSS next. My toughest task was getting the responsive design to work properply. 

### Built with

* HTML5
* Custom CSS Properties 
* CSS Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Responside Web Design

### Continued development

I want to work more with Responsive Web Design. It was really a challenge for me, but it was fun learning so much! The adjustments that you need to make in order for the page to be visual on mobile devices is not easy!
